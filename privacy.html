Notwithstanding the foregoing, Volacent grants the operators of public search engines permission to use spiders to copy materials from the website for the sole purpose of creating publicly available searchable indices of the materials, but not caches or archives of such materials. Volacent reserves the right to revoke these exceptions either generally or in specific cases. While we don't disallow the use of sniffers such as Ethereal, tcpdump or HTTPWatch in general, we do disallow any efforts to reverse-engineer our system, our protocols, or explore outside the boundaries of the normal requests made by Volacent clients. We have to disallow using request modification tools such as fiddler or whisker, or the like or any other such tools activities that are meant to explore or harm, penetrate or test the site. You must secure our permission before you measure, test, health check or otherwise monitor any network equipment, servers or assets hosted on our domain. You agree not to collect or harvest any personally identifiable information, including phone number, from the Service, nor to use the communication systems provided by the Service for any commercial solicitation or spam purposes. You agree not to spam, or solicit for commercial purposes, any users of the Service.
<p><p>4. Intellectual Property Rights</p></p>
The design of the Volacent Service along with Volacent created text, scripts, graphics, interactive features and the like, and the trademarks, service marks and logos contained therein ("Marks"), are owned by or licensed to Volacent, subject to copyright and other intellectual property rights under United States and foreign laws and international conventions. The Service is provided to you AS IS for your information and personal use only. Volacent reserves all rights not expressly granted in and to the Service.

This defense and indemnification obligation will survive these Terms of Service and your use of the Volacent Service. We don't support or encourage illegal consumption of alcohol or tobacco, so there.
<p><p>8. Ability to Accept Terms of Service</p></p>
You affirm that you are either more than 16 years of age, or an emancipated minor, or possess legal parental or guardian consent, and are fully able and competent to enter into the terms, conditions, obligations, affirmations, representations, and warranties set forth in these Terms of Service, and to abide by and comply with these Terms of Service.

<p><p>10. General</p></p>
You agree that: (i) the Volacent Service shall be deemed solely based in Israel; (ii) the Volacent Service shall be deemed a passive server that does not give rise to personal jurisdiction over Volacent, either specific or general, in jurisdictions other than Israel; and (iii) that you agree to subject to the jurisdiction of Israel in the event of any legal dispute. These Terms of Service shall be governed by the internal substantive laws of the State of Israel, without respect to its conflict of laws principles. Any claim or dispute between you and Volacent that arises in whole or in part from the Volacent Service shall be decided exclusively by a court of competent jurisdiction located in Tel Aviv, Israel. These Terms of Service, together with the Privacy Policy at http://www.Volacent.com/Privacy and any other legal notices published by Volacent, including, but not limited to an end user license agreement, shall constitute the entire agreement between you and Volacent concerning the Volacent Service. If any provision of these Terms of Service is deemed invalid by a court of competent jurisdiction, the invalidity of such provision shall not affect the validity of the remaining provisions of these Terms of Service, which shall remain in full force and effect. No waiver of any term of this these Terms of Service shall be deemed a further or continuing waiver of such term or any other term, and Volacent's failure to assert any right or provision under these Terms of Service shall not constitute a waiver of such right or provision. Volacent reserves the right to amend or modify these Terms of Service at any time, and it is your responsibility to review these Terms of Service for any changes. If you do not agree to the revised Terms, your only recourse is to discontinue the use of the Volacent Service. Your continued use of the Volacent Service following any amendment of these Terms of Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of its revised terms. YOU AND VOLACENT AGREE THAT ANY CAUSE OF ACTION ARISING OUT OF OR RELATED TO THE VOLACENT SERVICE MUST COMMENCE WITHIN ONE (1) YEAR AFTER THE CAUSE OF ACTION ACCRUES. OTHERWISE, SUCH CAUSE OF ACTION IS PERMANENTLY BARRED.


<p><p><p><p><h2>Privacy Notice</h2></p></p></p></p>
Volacent Inc. ("Volacent") recognizes that its customers, visitors and users, want to know what's up with privacy. Volacent provides this Privacy Policy to help you make an informed decision about whether to use or continue using the Volacent Site, Volacent Software and/or the Volacent Service. If you do not agree to our practices, please do not use the Volacent Site, Volacent Software,or Volacent Service.
This Privacy Policy is incorporated into and is subject to the Volacent Terms of Service. Your use of the Volacent Site, Volacent Software and the Volacent Service and any personal information you provide on the Volacent Site or Volacent Service remains subject to the terms of this Privacy Policy and our Terms of Service.
Please note that any Status Submissions or other content posted at the direction or discretion of users of the Volacent Service becomes published content and is not considered personally identifiable information subject to this Privacy Policy.
What Does This Privacy Policy Cover?
This Privacy Policy is part of Volacent’s Terms of Service and covers the treatment of user information, including personally identifying information, obtained by Volacent, including information obtained when you access the Volacent’s Site, use the Volacent Service or any other software provided by Volacent.
This Privacy Policy does not apply to the practices of companies that Volacent does not own or control, or to individuals whom Volacent does not employ or manage, including any of the third parties to which Volacent may disclose user information as set forth in this Privacy Policy.
The Information Volacent Collects
Volacent may obtain the following types of information from or concerning you or your mobile phone device, which may include information that can be used to identify you as specified below ("Personally Identifying Information"):
User Provided Information: You provide certain Personally Identifiable Information, such as your mobile phone number, push notification name (if applicable), billing information (if applicable) and mobile device information to Volacent when choosing to participate in various uses of the Volacent Service, such as registering as a user, updating your status or requesting status for your contacts. In order to provide the Volacent Service, Volacent will periodically access your address book or contact list on your mobile phone to locate the mobile phone numbers of other Volacent users ("in-network" numbers), or otherwise categorize other mobile phone numbers as "out-network" numbers, which are stored as one-way irreversibly hashed values.
<p><p>Cookies Information: </p></p>When you visit the Volacent Site, we may send one or more cookies - a small text file containing a string of alphanumeric characters - to your computer that uniquely identifies your browser. Volacent uses both session cookies and persistent cookies. A persistent cookie remains after you close your browser. Persistent cookies may be used by your browser on subsequent visits to the site. Persistent cookies can be removed by following your web browser help file directions. A session cookie is temporary and disappears after you close your browser. You can reset your web browser to refuse all cookies or to indicate when a cookie is being sent. However, the Volacent Site may not function properly if the ability to accept cookies is disabled.
<p><p>Log File Information: </p></p> When you use the Volacent Site, our servers automatically record certain information that your web browser sends whenever you visit any website. These server logs may include information such as your web request, Internet Protocol ("IP") address, browser type, browser language, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform type, number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on particular pages, the date and time of your request, one or more cookies that may uniquely identify your browser, your phone number, phone number you are requesting the status of and various status information. When you use the Volacent Service, our servers log certain general information that our application sends whenever a message is sent or received, or if you update or request any status information, including time and date stamps and the mobile phone numbers the messages were sent from and to.
<p><p>The Information Volacent Does Not Collect</p></p>
Volacent does not collect names, emails, addresses or other contact information from its users’ mobile address book or contact lists other than mobile phone numbers—the Volacent mobile application will associate whatever name the Volacent user has assigned to the mobile telephone number in his/her mobile address book or contact list — and this occurs dynamically on the mobile device itself and not on Volacent’s servers and is not transmitted to Volacent. This means that if you have your friend’s mobile phone number associated with the name "Shakespeare" in your mobile address book, that’s the name that will appear for that mobile phone number in your Volacent contact list. We do not collect location data, but users may voluntarily share their location with other users via the Volacent Service.
The contents of messages that have been delivered by the Volacent Service are not copied, kept or archived by Volacent in the normal course of business. The Volacent Service is meant to be a SMS replacement, using data service through a user’s phone (either via cell network or wifi). Users type their messages, which are sent via data service to our servers, and routed to the intended recipient (who must also be a Volacent user), if that recipient is online. If the recipient is not online, the undelivered message is held in Volacent’s server until it can be delivered. If the message is undelivered for thirty (30) days, the undelivered message is deleted from our servers. Once a message has been delivered, it no longer resides on our servers. The contents of any delivered messages are not kept or retained by Volacent — the only records of the content of any delivered messages reside directly on the sender’s and recipient’s mobile devices (and which may be deleted at the user’s option). Notwithstanding the above, Volacent may retain date and time stamp information associated with successfully delivered messages and the mobile phone numbers involved in the messages, as well as any other information which Volacent is legally compelled to collect. Files that are sent through the Volacent Service will reside on our servers after delivery for a short period of time, but are deleted and stripped of any identifiable information within a short period of time in accordance with our general retention policies.
<p><p>The Way Volacent Uses Information</p></p>
If you submit Personally Identifiable Information to us through the Volacent Site, or Volacent Service, then we use your personal information to operate, maintain, and provide to you the features and functionality of the Volacent Site and Volacent Service. In particular, your Android Gmail Address is essential to your use of the Volacent Service and will be retained. Any billing information that may be collected from you will be deleted thirty (30) days after the termination of your account with Volacent. Any Personally Identifiable Information or status content that you voluntarily disclose on the Volacent Service becomes publicly available and may be collected and used by other users of the Volacent Service (unless such user is blocked by you). Your name (as it is saved in other user's mobile phone address book or contact list) may be displayed to other users when you update your status messages through the Volacent Service and other users may contact you through the Volacent Service. We do not use your mobile phone number or other Personally Identifiable Information to send commercial or marketing messages without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may, however, use your mobile phone number (or email address, if provided) without further consent for non-marketing or administrative purposes (such as notifying you of major Volacent Site or Volacent Service changes or for customer service purposes). We may use both your Personally Identifiable Information and certain non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous user usage data, cookies, IP addresses, browser type, clickstream data, etc.) to improve the quality and design of the Volacent Site and Volacent Service and to create new features, promotions, functionality, and services by storing, tracking, and analyzing user preferences and trends. Hopefully we improve the Volacent Site and Service and don't make it suck worse. We may use cookies and log file information to: (a) remember information so that you will not have to re-enter it during your visit or the next time you use the Volacent Service or Volacent Site; (b) provide custom, personalized content and information; (c) monitor individual and aggregate metrics such as total number of visitors, pages viewed, etc.; and (d) track your entries, submissions, views and such.
<p><p>When Volacent Discloses Information</p></p>
We do not sell or share your Personally Identifiable Information (such as mobile phone number) with other third-party companies for their commercial or marketing use without your consent or except as part of a specific program or feature for which you will have the ability to opt-in or opt-out. We may share your Personally Identifiable Information with third party service providers to the extent that it is reasonably necessary to perform, improve or maintain the Volacent Service. We may share non-personally-identifiable information (such as anonymous User usage data, referring / exit pages and URLs, platform types, asset views, number of clicks, etc.) with interested third-parties to assist them in understanding the usage patterns for certain content, services, advertisements, promotions, and/or functionality on the Volacent Site. We may collect and release Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information if required to do so by law, or in the good-faith belief that such action is necessary to comply with state and federal laws (such as U.S. Copyright Law), international law or respond to a court order, subpoena, or search warrant or equivalent, or where in our reasonable belief, an individual’s physical safety may be at risk or threatened. Volacent also reserves the right to disclose Personally Identifiable Information and/or non-personally-identifiable information that Volacent believes, in good faith, is appropriate or necessary to enforce our Terms of Service, take precautions against liability, to investigate and defend itself against any third-party claims or allegations, to assist government enforcement agencies, to protect the security or integrity of the Volacent Site or our servers, and to protect the rights, property, or personal safety of Volacent, our users or others.
<p><p>Your Choices</p></p>
You may, of course, decline to submit Personally Identifiable Information through the Volacent Site or the Volacent Service, in which case Volacent may not be able to provide certain services to you. If you do not agree with our Privacy Policy or Terms of Service, please delete your account, uninstall the Volacent mobile application and discontinue use of the Volacent Service; your continued usage of the Volacent Service will signify your assent to and acceptance of our Privacy Policy and Terms of Service. To protect your privacy and security, we take reasonable steps (such as SMS authentication in certain cases) to verify your identity before registering your mobile phone number and granting you access to the Volacent Service. Please contact Volacent via email to support at Volacent.com or available web forms with any questions or comments about this Privacy Policy, your personal information, your consent, or your opt-in or opt-out choices.
<p><p>Special Note to International Users</p></p>
The Volacent Site and Service are hosted in Israel and are intended for and directed to users in Israel. If you are a user accessing the Volacent Site and Service from the United States, European Union, Asia, or any other region with laws or regulations governing personal data collection, use, and disclosure, that differ from United States laws, please be advised that through your continued use of the Volacent Site and Service, which are governed by Israel law, this Privacy Policy, and our Terms of Service, you are transferring your personal information to the United States and you expressly consent to that transfer and consent to be governed by Israel law for these purposes.
<p><p>In the Event of Merger, Sale, or Bankruptcy</p></p>
In the event that Volacent is acquired by or merged with a third party entity, we reserve the right to transfer or assign the information we have collected from our users as part of such merger, acquisition, sale, or other change of control. In the (hopefully) unlikely event of our bankruptcy, insolvency, reorganization, receivership, or assignment for the benefit of creditors, or the application of laws or equitable principles affecting creditors' rights generally, we may not be able to control how your personal information is treated, transferred, or used.
<p><p>Changes and updates to this Privacy Notice</p></p>
This Privacy Policy may be revised periodically and this will be reflected by the "effective date" below. Please revisit this page to stay aware of any changes. Your continued use of the Volacent Site and Volacent Service constitutes your agreement to this Privacy Policy and any amendments.

                  </p></p>
